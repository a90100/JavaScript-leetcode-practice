# 642. Design Search Autocomplete System

## 題目說明

Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine. Users may input a sentence (at least one word and end with a special character `'#'`).

You are given a string array `sentences` and an integer array `times` both of length `n` where `sentences[i]` is a previously typed sentence and `times[i]` is the corresponding number of times the sentence was typed. For each input character except `'#'`, return the top `3` historical hot sentences that have the same prefix as the part of the sentence already typed.

Here are the specific rules:

* The hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed the exactly same sentence before.
* The returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first is the hottest one). If several sentences have the same hot degree, use ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).
* If less than `3` hot sentences exist, return as many as you can.
* When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, you need to return an empty list.

Implement the `AutocompleteSystem` class:

* `AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times)` Initializes the object with the `sentences` and `times` arrays.
* `List<String> input(char c)` This indicates that the user typed the character `c`.
  * Returns an empty array `[]` if `c == '#'` and stores the inputted sentence in the system.
  * Returns the top `3` historical hot sentences that have the same prefix as the part of the sentence already typed. If there are fewer than `3` matches, return them all.

Example 1:

```
Input
["AutocompleteSystem", "input", "input", "input", "input"]
[[["i love you", "island", "iroman", "i love leetcode"], [5, 3, 2, 2]], ["i"], [" "], ["a"], ["#"]]
Output
[null, ["i love you", "island", "i love leetcode"], ["i love you", "i love leetcode"], [], []]

Explanation
AutocompleteSystem obj = new AutocompleteSystem(["i love you", "island", "iroman", "i love leetcode"], [5, 3, 2, 2]);
obj.input("i"); // return ["i love you", "island", "i love leetcode"]. There are four sentences that have prefix "i". Among them, "ironman" and "i love leetcode" have same hot degree. Since ' ' has ASCII code 32 and 'r' has ASCII code 114, "i love leetcode" should be in front of "ironman". Also we only need to output top 3 hot sentences, so "ironman" will be ignored.
obj.input(" "); // return ["i love you", "i love leetcode"]. There are only two sentences that have prefix "i ".
obj.input("a"); // return []. There are no sentences that have prefix "i a".
obj.input("#"); // return []. The user finished the input, the sentence "i a" should be saved as a historical sentence in system. And the following input will be counted as a new search.
```

Constraints:

```
n == sentences.length
n == times.length
1 <= n <= 100
1 <= sentences[i].length <= 100
1 <= times[i] <= 50
c is a lowercase English letter, a hash '#', or space ' '.
Each tested sentence will be a sequence of characters c that end with the character '#'.
Each tested sentence will have a length in the range [1, 200].
The words in each input sentence are separated by single spaces.
At most 5000 calls will be made to input.
```

## 解題程式碼

參考 [JavaScript Solution (Trie)](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-search-autocomplete-system/solutions/443177/javascript-solution-trie/)

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} sentences
 * @param {number[]} times
 */
var AutocompleteSystem = function (sentences, times) {
  this.trie = {};
  this.inputStr = '';

  for (let i = 0; i < sentences.length; i++) {
    this.insert(sentences[i], times[i]);
  }
};

/**
 * @param {string}
 * @return {}
 */
AutocompleteSystem.prototype.insert = function (sentence, times) {
  let cur = this.trie;

  for (let char of sentence) {
    if (!cur[char]) cur[char] = {};
    cur = cur[char];
  }
  cur.isEnd = true;
  cur.times = cur.times ? cur.times + 1 : times;
};

/**
 * @param {character}
 * @return {string[]}
 */
AutocompleteSystem.prototype.input = function (c) {
  if (c == '#') {
    this.insert(this.inputStr, 1);
    this.inputStr = '';
    return [];
  }

  this.inputStr += c;
  let cur = this.trie;
  let result = {};
  // initial traverse
  for (let char of this.inputStr) {
    if (!cur[char]) return [];
    cur = cur[char];
  }

  let DFS = function (root, char) {
    for (let key in root) {
      if (key === 'isEnd') {
        // found a complete sentence
        if (!result[root.times]) result[root.times] = []; // housekeeping initialize
        result[root.times].push(char);
        result[root.times].sort();
      }
      DFS(root[key], char + key);
    }
  };

  // DFS on rest of the nodes
  DFS(cur, this.inputStr);

  // sort and filter
  let sorted = [];
  let sortedKeys = [...Object.keys(result)].sort((a, b) => b - a);
  for (let key of sortedKeys) sorted.push(...result[key]);

  return sorted.slice(0, 3);
};
```

## 解題思路、演算法

## 解法的時間、空間複雜度

時間複雜度: `O(n * k + m * (n + (k / m)) * log(n + (k / m)))`，n 為 sentences 長，k 為 sentences 元素平均長，m 為 input 呼叫次數，`n * k` 是初始化 trie，然後 `k / m 為後來加入的字串數`，加上本來的 n 個字串，然後又有排序
空間複雜度: `O(k * (n * k + m))`，result 用的記憶體空間？
