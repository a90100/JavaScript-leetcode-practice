# 1136. Parallel Courses

## 題目說明

You are given an integer `n`, which indicates that there are `n` courses labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given an array `relations` where `relations[i] = [prevCoursei, nextCoursei]`, representing a prerequisite relationship between course `prevCoursei` and course `nextCoursei`: course `prevCoursei` has to be taken before course `nextCoursei`.

In one semester, you can take **any number** of courses as long as you have taken all the prerequisites in the **previous** semester for the courses you are taking.

Return *the **minimum** number of semesters needed to take all courses*. If there is no way to take all the courses, return `-1`.

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph.
In the first semester, you can take courses 1 and 2.
In the second semester, you can take course 3.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: No course can be studied because they are prerequisites of each other.
```

Constraints:

```
1 <= n <= 5000
1 <= relations.length <= 5000
relations[i].length == 2
1 <= prevCoursei, nextCoursei <= n
prevCoursei != nextCoursei
All the pairs [prevCoursei, nextCoursei] are unique.
```

## 解題程式碼

自己解：

```javascript
var minimumSemesters = function (n, relations) {
  const graph = new Map();
  const indegrees = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  const queue = [];
  let semesters = 0;
  const visited = new Set();

  for (const [e, v] of relations) {
    graph.has(e) ? graph.get(e).push(v) : graph.set(e, [v]);
    indegrees[v]++;
  }

  for (let i = 1; i < indegrees.length; i++) {
    if (indegrees[i] === 0) queue.push(i);
  }

  while (queue.length) {
    let len = queue.length;
    semesters++;

    for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      const node = queue.shift();
      if (visited.has(node)) continue;
      visited.add(node);

      const neighbors = graph.get(node) ?? [];
      for (let j = 0; j < neighbors.length; j++) {
        if (--indegrees[neighbors[j]] === 0) queue.push(neighbors[j]);
      }
    }
  }

  return visited.size !== n ? -1 : semesters;
};
```

也可以用 DFS 做，假設所有節點都有遍歷到，沒有形成環，則 DFS 遞迴的最多 call stack 層數就是花費最少的學期數。

## 解題思路、演算法

標準的拓撲排序題目，沒有太多變化。

## 解法的時間、空間複雜度

時間複雜度: O(n + v)，n 為節點數，v 為邊數
空間複雜度: O(n + v)
