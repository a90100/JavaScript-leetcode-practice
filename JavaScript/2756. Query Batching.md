# 2756. Query Batching

## 題目說明

Batching multiple small queries into a single large query can be a useful optimization. Write a class `QueryBatcher` that implements this functionality.

The constructor should accept two parameters:

- An asynchronous function `queryMultiple` which accepts an array of string keys `input`. It will resolve with an array of values that is the same length as the input array. Each index corresponds to the value associated with `input[i]`. You can assume the promise will never reject.
- A throttle time in milliseconds `t`.

The class has a single method.

- `async getValue(key)`. Accepts a single string key and resolves with a single string value. The keys passed to this function should eventually get passed to the `queryMultiple` function. `queryMultiple` should never be called consecutively within t milliseconds. The first time `getValue` is called, `queryMultiple` should immediately be called with that single key. If after `t` milliseconds, `getValue` had been called again, all the passed keys should be passed to `queryMultiple` and ultimately returned. You can assume every key passed to this method is unique.

The following diagram illustrates how the throttling algorithm works. Each rectangle represents 100ms. The throttle time is 400ms.

Example 1:

```
Input:
queryMultiple = async function(keys) {
  return keys.map(key => key + '!');
}
t = 100
calls = [
 {"key": "a", "time": 10},
 {"key": "b", "time": 20},
 {"key": "c", "time": 30}
]
Output: [
 {"resolved": "a!", "time": 10},
 {"resolved": "b!", "time": 110},
 {"resolved": "c!", "time": 110}
]
Explanation:
const batcher = new QueryBatcher(queryMultiple, 100);
setTimeout(() => batcher.getValue('a'), 10); // "a!" at t=10ms
setTimeout(() => batcher.getValue('b'), 20); // "b!" at t=110ms
setTimeout(() => batcher.getValue('c'), 30); // "c!" at t=110ms

queryMultiple simply adds an "!" to the key
At t=10ms, getValue('a') is called, queryMultiple(['a']) is immediately called and the result is immediately returned.
At t=20ms, getValue('b') is called but the query is queued
At t=30ms, getValue('c') is called but the query is queued.
At t=110ms, queryMultiple(['a', 'b']) is called and the results are immediately returned.
```

Example 2:

```
Input:
queryMultiple = async function(keys) {
  await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100));
  return keys.map(key => key + '!');
}
t = 100
calls = [
 {"key": "a", "time": 10},
 {"key": "b", "time": 20},
 {"key": "c", "time": 30}
]
Output: [
  {"resolved": "a!", "time": 110},
  {"resolved": "b!", "time": 210},
  {"resolved": "c!", "time": 210}
]
Explanation:
This example is the same as example 1 except there is a 100ms delay in queryMultiple. The results are the same except the promises resolve 100ms later.
```

Example 3:

```
Input:
queryMultiple = async function(keys) {
  await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, keys.length * 100));
  return keys.map(key => key + '!');
}
t = 100
calls = [
  {"key": "a", "time": 10},
  {"key": "b", "time": 20},
  {"key": "c", "time": 30},
  {"key": "d", "time": 40},
  {"key": "e", "time": 250}
  {"key": "f", "time": 300}
]
Output: [
  {"resolved":"a!","time":110},
  {"resolved":"e!","time":350},
  {"resolved":"b!","time":410},
  {"resolved":"c!","time":410},
  {"resolved":"d!","time":410},
  {"resolved":"f!","time":450}
]
Explanation:
queryMultiple(['a']) is called at t=10ms, it is resolved at t=110ms
queryMultiple(['b', 'c', 'd']) is called at t=110ms, it is resolved at 410ms
queryMultiple(['e']) is called at t=250ms, it is resolved at 350ms
queryMultiple(['f']) is called at t=350ms, it is resolved at 450ms
```

Constraints:

```
0 <= t <= 1000
0 <= calls.length <= 10
1 <= key.length <= 100
All keys are unique
```

## 解題程式碼

官方題解：

```javascript
/**
 * @param {Function} queryMultiple
 * @param {number} t
 * @return {void}
 */
var QueryBatcher = function (queryMultiple, t) {
  this.queryMultiple = queryMultiple;
  this.t = t;
  this.isAvailable = true; // 用於判斷是否可以馬上處理 query
  this.stashed = []; // 在延遲時間(throttle time)還沒到前暫存 queries 的陣列
};

/**
 * @param {string} key
 * @return {Promise<string>}
 */
QueryBatcher.prototype.getValue = async function (key) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    if (this.isAvailable) {
      this.isAvailable = false;
      this.queryMultiple([key]).then((results) => resolve(results[0]));
      this.cooldown(); // 進入到延遲時間
      return;
    }
    // 假設還未執行，儲存該 query
    this.stashed.push({ key, resolve });
  });
};

QueryBatcher.prototype.cooldown = function () {
  setTimeout(() => {
    // 假設在延遲時間後沒有 queries，接下來就可以馬上處理下一次呼叫的函式
    if (this.stashed.length === 0) {
      this.isAvailable = true;
      return;
    }

    const keysToQuery = this.stashed.map((item) => item.key);
    const resolvers = this.stashed.map((item) => item.resolve);

    this.stashed = [];

    // 執行所有的 queries
    this.queryMultiple(keysToQuery).then((results) => {
      resolvers.forEach((resolve, idx) => {
        resolve(results[idx]);
      });
    });

    // 為下一次 batch 進行 cooldown
    this.cooldown();
  }, this.t);
};
```

[Most intuitive solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/query-batching/solutions/5990300/most-intuitive-solution/)

這題的確具有 throttle 的概念在，只是延後處理的變成了非同步函式。

```javascript
var throttle = function (fn, t) {
  let prevTime = 0;
  let timeId = null;

  return function (...args) {
    const curTime = new Date().getTime();
    let remain = Math.max(t - (curTime - prevTime), 0);

    clearTimeout(timeId);

    timeId = setTimeout(() => {
      fn(...args);
      prevTime = new Date().getTime();
    }, remain);
  };
};

/**
 * @param {Function} queryMultiple
 * @param {number} t
 * @return {void}
 */
var QueryBatcher = function (queryMultiple, t) {
  this.keys = [];
  this.resolvers = [];
  this.run = throttle(async () => {
    const keys = this.keys;
    const resolvers = this.resolvers;
    this.keys = [];
    this.resolvers = [];

    const results = await queryMultiple(keys);
    results.forEach((result, index) => {
      resolvers[index](result);
    });
    // 上面四行也可以這樣寫：
    //     queryMultiple(keys).then((results) => {
    //     resolvers.forEach((resolve, index) => {
    //         resolve(results[index]);
    //     });
    // });

    // 範例 3，results 會依序印出：
    // [ 'a!' ]
    // [ 'e!' ]
    // [ 'b!', 'c!', 'd!' ]
    // [ 'f!' ]
  }, t);
};

/**
 * @param {string} key
 * @return {Promise<string>}
 */
QueryBatcher.prototype.getValue = async function (key) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    this.keys.push(key);
    this.resolvers.push(resolve);
    this.run();
  });
};
```

### Use Cases of `QueryBatcher`

#### 1. Optimized Data Retrieval in Applications

When building applications that rely on multiple data points, it's common to initiate several small query requests. Using `QueryBatcher`, these requests can be optimized by grouping them, reducing the overhead and improving the application's performance.

```javascript
const dataKeys = ['userProfile', 'userSettings', 'userNotifications'];
const batcher = new QueryBatcher(queryFunction, 50);
dataKeys.forEach((key) => batcher.getValue(key).then(console.log)); // The last two keys might be batched together based on timings
```

#### 2. Load Management in Backend Systems

Backend systems often deal with burst traffic, leading to spikes in query requests. By implementing a query batcher mechanism, it's possible to distribute the load more evenly over time, ensuring system stability and preventing potential overloads.

> Note: When implementing `QueryBatcher` in backend systems, always consider other factors like database locks, concurrent writes, and transactional integrity.

```javascript
const incomingRequests = ['queryA', 'queryB', 'queryC'];
const batcher = new QueryBatcher(databaseQueryFunction, 100);
incomingRequests.forEach((req) => batcher.getValue(req).then(console.log)); // Depending on the throttle time, some queries may be batched
```
