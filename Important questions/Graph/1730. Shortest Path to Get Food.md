# 1730. Shortest Path to Get Food

## 題目說明

You are starving and you want to eat food as quickly as possible. You want to find the shortest path to arrive at any food cell.

You are given an `m x n` character matrix, `grid`, of these different types of cells:

- `'*'` is your location. There is **exactly one** `'*'` cell.
- `'#'` is a food cell. There may be **multiple** food cells.
- `'O'` is free space, and you can travel through these cells.
- `'X'` is an obstacle, and you cannot travel through these cells.

You can travel to any adjacent cell north, east, south, or west of your current location if there is not an obstacle.

Return the **length** of the shortest path for you to reach **any** food cell. If there is no path for you to reach food, return -1.

```
Input: grid = [["X","X","X","X","X","X"],["X","*","O","O","O","X"],["X","O","O","#","O","X"],["X","X","X","X","X","X"]]
Output: 3
Explanation: It takes 3 steps to reach the food.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: grid = [["X","X","X","X","X"],["X","*","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","#","X"],["X","X","X","X","X"]]
Output: -1
Explanation: It is not possible to reach the food.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: grid = [["X","X","X","X","X","X","X","X"],["X","*","O","X","O","#","O","X"],["X","O","O","X","O","O","X","X"],["X","O","O","O","O","#","O","X"],["X","X","X","X","X","X","X","X"]]
Output: 6
Explanation: There can be multiple food cells. It only takes 6 steps to reach the bottom food.
```

Constraints:

```
m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
grid[row][col] is '*', 'X', 'O', or '#'.
The grid contains exactly one '*'.
```

## 解題程式碼

```javascript
var getFood = function (grid) {
  const queue = [];
  let steps = 1;

  for (let i = 0, x = 1; i < grid.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++) {
      if (grid[i][j] == '*') {
        queue.push([i, j]);
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  while (queue.length) {
    let len = queue.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      const [x, y] = queue.shift();
      for (let [newX, newY] of [
        [x, y + 1],
        [x, y - 1],
        [x + 1, y],
        [x - 1, y],
      ]) {
        if (newX < 0 || newY < 0 || newX >= grid.length || newY >= grid[0].length || grid[newX][newY] === 'X') continue;

        if (grid[newX][newY] === '#') return steps;
        grid[newX][newY] = 'X';
        queue.push([newX, newY]);
      }
    }
    steps++;
  }

  return -1;
};
```

## 解題思路、演算法

通常做 matrix/graph 的題目，看到 shortest path，那代表可以用 BFS 解題。

所以從起點開始 BFS，往四個方向查找，每次查找路徑 + 1，找到食物後就回傳路徑，BFS 結束沒找到則回傳 -1。

## 解法的時間、空間複雜度

時間複雜度: `O(m * n)`
空間複雜度: `O(m * n)`
