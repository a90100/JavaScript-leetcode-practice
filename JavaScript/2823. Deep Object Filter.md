# 2823. Deep Object Filter

## 題目說明

Given an object or an array `obj` and a function `fn`, return a filtered object or array `filteredObject`.

Function `deepFilter` should perform a deep filter operation on the `obj`. The deep filter operation should remove properties for which the output of the filter function `fn` is `false`, as well as any empty objects or arrays that remain after the keys have been removed.

If the deep filter operation results in an empty object or array, with no remaining properties, `deepFilter` should return `undefined` to indicate that there is no valid data left in the `filteredObject`.

Example 1:

```
Input:
obj = [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1],
fn = (x) => x > 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: All values that were not greater than 0 were removed.
```

Example 2:

```
Input:
obj = {"a": 1, "b": "2", "c": 3, "d": "4", "e": 5, "f": 6, "g": {"a": 1}},
fn = (x) => typeof x === "string"
Output: {"b":"2","d":"4"}
Explanation: All keys with values that were not a string were removed. When the object keys were removed during the filtering process, any resulting empty objects were also removed.
```

Example 3:

```
Input:
obj = [-1, [-1, -1, 5, -1, 10], -1, [-1], [-5]],
fn = (x) => x > 0
Output: [[5,10]]
Explanation: All values that were not greater than 0 were removed. When the values were removed during the filtering process, any resulting empty arrays were also removed.
```

Example 4:

```
Input:
obj = [[[[5]]]],
fn = (x) => Array.isArray(x)
Output: undefined
```

Constraints:

```
fn is a function that returns a boolean value
obj is a valid JSON object or array
2 <= JSON.stringify(obj).length <= 10^5
```

## 解題程式碼

```javascript
var deepFilter = function (obj, fn) {
  if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
    const res = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < obj.length; i++) {
      let filterChildren = deepFilter(obj[i], fn); // 要記得存的是過濾後的子元素
      if (filterChildren === undefined) continue;
      res.push(filterChildren);
    }

    return JSON.stringify(res) === '[]' ? undefined : res;
  } else if (typeof obj === 'object' && obj !== null) {
    const res = {};

    for (const key of Object.keys(obj)) {
      let filterChildren = deepFilter(obj[key], fn);
      if (filterChildren === undefined) continue;
      res[key] = filterChildren;
    }

    return JSON.stringify(res) === '{}' ? undefined : res;
  }

  // 原始型別，丟進去 fn
  return fn(obj) ? obj : undefined;
};
```

## 解題思路、演算法

## 解法的時間、空間複雜度

時間複雜度: O(n)，n 是物件的所有屬性/值的數量
空間複雜度: O(n + d)，d 是物件巢狀的層數
