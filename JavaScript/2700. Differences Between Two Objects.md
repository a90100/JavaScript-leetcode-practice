# 2700. Differences Between Two Objects

## 題目說明

Write a function that accepts two deeply nested objects or arrays `obj1` and `obj2` and returns a new object representing their differences.

The function should compare the properties of the two objects and identify any changes. The returned object should only contains keys where the value is different from `obj1` to `obj2`.

For each changed key, the value should be represented as an array `[obj1 value, obj2 value]`. Keys that exist in one object but not in the other should not be included in the returned object. The end result should be a deeply nested object where each leaf value is a difference array.

When comparing two arrays, the indices of the arrays are considered to be their keys. 

You may assume that both objects are the output of `JSON.parse`.

Example 1:

```
Input: 
obj1 = {}
obj2 = {
  "a": 1, 
  "b": 2
}
Output: {}
Explanation: There were no modifications made to obj1. New keys "a" and "b" appear in obj2, but keys that are added or removed should be ignored.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: 
obj1 = {
  "a": 1,
  "v": 3,
  "x": [],
  "z": {
    "a": null
  }
}
obj2 = {
  "a": 2,
  "v": 4,
  "x": [],
  "z": {
    "a": 2
  }
}
Output: 
{
  "a": [1, 2],
  "v": [3, 4],
  "z": {
    "a": [null, 2]
  }
}
Explanation: The keys "a", "v", and "z" all had changes applied. "a" was changed from 1 to 2. "v" was changed from 3 to 4. "z" had a change applied to a child object. "z.a" was changed from null to 2.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: 
obj1 = {
  "a": 5, 
  "v": 6, 
  "z": [1, 2, 4, [2, 5, 7]]
}
obj2 = {
  "a": 5, 
  "v": 7, 
  "z": [1, 2, 3, [1]]
}
Output: 
{
  "v": [6, 7],
  "z": {
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": {
      "0": [2, 1]
    }
  }
}
Explanation: In obj1 and obj2, the keys "v" and "z" have different assigned values. "a" is ignored because the value is unchanged. In the key "z", there is a nested array. Arrays are treated like objects where the indices are keys. There were two alterations to the the array: z[2] and z[3][0]. z[0] and z[1] were unchanged and thus not included. z[3][1] and z[3][2] were removed and thus not included.
```

Example 4:

```
Input: 
obj1 = {
  "a": {"b": 1}, 
}
obj2 = {
  "a": [5],
}
Output: 
{
  "a": [{"b": 1}, [5]]
}
Explanation: The key "a" exists in both objects. Since the two associated values have different types, they are placed in the difference array.
```

Example 5:

```
Input: 
obj1 = {
  "a": [1, 2, {}], 
  "b": false
}
obj2 = {   
  "b": false,
  "a": [1, 2, {}]
}
Output: 
{}
Explanation: Apart from a different ordering of keys, the two objects are identical so an empty object is returned.
```

Constraints:

```
obj1 and obj2 are valid JSON objects or arrays
2 <= JSON.stringify(obj1).length <= 104
2 <= JSON.stringify(obj2).length <= 104
```

## 解題程式碼

### 自己解題：

```javascript
function objDiff(obj1, obj2) {
  const checkHelper = (obj1, obj2) => {
    // 兩個都是原始型別
    if (typeof obj1 !== 'object' && typeof obj2 !== 'object') {
      return obj1 === obj2 ? undefined : [obj1, obj2];
    }

    const res = {};
    // 兩個都是陣列
    if (Array.isArray(obj1) && Array.isArray(obj2)) {
      for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(obj1.length, obj2.length); i++) {
        let diff = checkHelper(obj1[i], obj2[i]);
        if (diff !== undefined) {
          res[i] = diff;
        }
      }
      return JSON.stringify(res) === '{}' ? undefined : res;
    }

    // 兩個都是物件
    if (Object.prototype.toString.call(obj1) === '[object Object]' && Object.prototype.toString.call(obj2) === '[object Object]') {
      for (const key of Object.keys(obj1)) {
        if (obj2[key] !== undefined) {
          let diff = checkHelper(obj1[key], obj2[key]);
          if (diff !== undefined) {
            res[key] = diff;
          }
        }
      }
      return JSON.stringify(res) === '{}' ? undefined : res;
    }

    return [obj1, obj2];
  };
  let res = checkHelper(obj1, obj2);

  return res === undefined ? {} : res;
}
```

### NeetCode：

[Difference Between Two Objects - Leetcode 2700 - JavaScript 30-Day Challenge](https://youtu.be/gH7oZs1WZfg)

```javascript
const isObject = (obj) => typeof obj === 'object' && obj !== null;

function objDiff(obj1, obj2) {
  if (!isObject(obj1) && !isObject(obj2)) {
    // 都是原始型別
    return obj1 === obj2 ? {} : [obj1, obj2];
  }

  // 一個是原始型別，一個不是
  // 或者 一個是物件，一個是陣列
  if (!isObject(obj1) || !isObject(obj2) || Array.isArray(obj1) !== Array.isArray(obj2)) {
    return [obj1, obj2];
  }

  const res = {};
  for (const key in obj1) {
    if (obj2.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
      const diff = objDiff(obj1[key], obj2[key]);
      if (Object.keys(diff).length) {
        res[key] = diff;
      }
    }
  }

  return res;
}
```

和自己解法的差別：

1. 先把回傳是陣列的狀況處理完了
2. 剩下一律回傳物件，空物件就代表屬性值一樣，用 `Object.keys(diff).length` 判斷是否加入屬性和值到 res
3. 用了 for in 迴圈同時處理物件和陣列，物件是遍歷屬性，陣列是遍歷索引
4. 用 `hasOwnProperty` 判斷屬性是否存在

### LeetCode 官方：和 NeetCode 很像

```javascript
function objDiff(obj1, obj2) {
  if (obj1 === obj2) return {};
  if (obj1 === null || obj2 === null) return [obj1, obj2];
  if (typeof obj1 !== 'object' || typeof obj2 !== 'object') return [obj1, obj2]; // 一個是原始型別，一個不是
  if (Array.isArray(obj1) !== Array.isArray(obj2)) return [obj1, obj2]; // 一個是物件，一個是陣列

  const returnObject = {};
  for (const key in obj1) {
    if (key in obj2) {
      const subDiff = objDiff(obj1[key], obj2[key]);
      if (Object.keys(subDiff).length > 0) {
        returnObject[key] = subDiff;
      }
    }
  }
  return returnObject;
}
```

## 解題思路、演算法

自己解題的程式碼大致結構和 2628. JSON Deep Equal 相似。

## 解法的時間、空間複雜度

時間複雜度: O(n)，兩個物件共同 key 數
空間複雜度: O(d)，巢狀物件層數

### Use-cases for Finding Differences Between Objects

#### Visualizations

Imagine you had a large object representing the state of all or part of your application, and you are trying to better understand the code by seeing what parts of state are effected by different actions a user performs.

Rather than manually explore the two JSON files before and after the user action, it would be better to have an algorithm display exactly what the changes are and nothing else.

Redux is a popular state management library based off the core principle of actions effecting a large, immutable state object. One reason it is popular is the transparency it provides into what exactly is effected by a given action. And Redux DevTools is a popular tool for visualizing this, and it provides a JSON difference tool as a core feature.

#### Efficiently Storing Past Versions of a File.

Suppose you wanted to implement persistent autosave feature in some app which, at its core, modifies a large JavaScript object. The simplest way would be to store a copy of each object in a file, every time a user performs an action. Then, when the user wants to revert to an earlier version, they simply select the file and load it. However, this is inefficient. A huge amount of data is just copied from one file to the next. A solution which would take up less storage is to only store differences between files. It would require some processing to create the desired file by applying the updates, but it would take up considerably less storage.
